 2.What are the charactistics of a component?

* Reusability

* Replaceable

* Not context specific

* Extensible

* Encapsulated

* Independent

3.What are the advantages of using component based architecture?

* Ease of deployment

* Reduced cost

* Ease of development

* Reusable

* Modification of technical complexity

* Reliability

* System maintenance and evolution

* Independent
