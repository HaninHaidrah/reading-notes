# Project Ideas

* What ideas do you have for projects? What would your model be that you can control and update the view with? What API(s) could you use to make this a reality?

1. The idea that I have is to create an app for living a healthy life style.

* the app will start with home page a small description about the app with a button at the end to log in once you clicked you will go to login screen its a form to get your email and password.

* the other screen will be for attrack your work by checking your what did you do as a droplist and check.

* the other one will be as a screen for healthy recipes once you click you will get the recipes with ingredients.

2.App for learning English Language providing the user with vedios and daily goals.
