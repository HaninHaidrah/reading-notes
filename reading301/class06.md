# JS NODES

1. What is node.js? its a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine? Its an engin improved by google to use it with chrome and it runs J.s
3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime? That achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests. In other words, Node. js wastes no time or resources on waiting for I/O requests to return
4. What is npm? npm is the world's largest Software Registry.
5. What version of node are you running on your machine? 6.14.13
6. What version of npm are you running on your machine? 6.14.13

7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’? npm install jshint
8. What is node used for? Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser. Node can, therefore, be used to write server-side applications with access to the operating system, file system, and everything else required to build fully-functional applications.

## pair programming

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

* 1. Greater efficiency
* 2. Engaged collaboration
* 3. Learning from fellow students
* 4. Social skills
* 5. Job interview readiness
* 6. Work environment readiness

2.In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
I think Engaged because When we were focusing on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both of us were more focused than if we were working alone.

3.How does pair programming work?
 The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
