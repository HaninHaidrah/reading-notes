# Data Modeling
1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
* The code is easier to maintain. ...
* Code refactoring goes more smoothly. ...
* Project costs descrease; ROI goes up. ...
* TDD documents the code better. ..
2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
    * before():  is run once before all the tests in a describe.
    * after() is run once after all the tests in a describe. 
    * beforeEach() is run before each test in a describe. 
    * afterEach() is run after each test in a describe. Which one you want to use depends  on your actual test
3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development:
    * The tests are dependent on external dependencies. ...
    * The tests are hard to write because the code is more complex to write and understand.
    * The development of the code is slow
4. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
    * ES6 class constructors	
        This can be said to be a syntax base for constructor functions and instantiate objects using a new operator.	
    * ES5 function constructors 
        This also uses a new operator for object creation but focuses on how the objects are being instantiated. 
5. Why REST?
   * Why is REST useful?
       One of the key advantages of REST APIs is that they provide a great deal of flexibility. Data is not tied to resources or methods, so REST can handle multiple types of calls, return different data formats and even change structurally with the correct implementation of hypermedia.


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
Term: 
1. functional programming : Functional programming (also called FP) is a way of thinking about software construction by creating pure functions. It avoid concepts of shared state, mutable data observed in Object Oriented Programming. Functional langauges empazies on expressions and declarations rather than execution of statements.
2. object-oriented programming (OOP): Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is that an object's own procedures can access and often modify the data fields of itself
3. class : A JavaScript class is a blueprint for creating objects. A class encapsulates data and functions that manipulate data
4. super : a reference variable to the parent class
5. this :keyword refers to the object it belongs to.
6. Test Driven Development (TDD): Test Driven Development (TDD)
7. Jest: a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
8. Continuous Integration (CI) : The continuous integration should make sure that the JavaScript application is built and tested with every change in the code base that reaches your CI. For instance, the CI would fail if the tests are not running through successfully or if the build process would fail.
10. REST: a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array, providing a way to represent variadic functions in JavaScript.
