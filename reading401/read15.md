# Trees

- dicussion: A tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes, where each node is a data structure consisting of a value and a list of references to nodes. The start of the tree is the "root node" and the reference nodes are the "children". No reference is duplicated and none points to the root.

## Properties-
 

***The important properties of tree data structure are-**

   - There is one and only one path between every pair of vertices in a tree.
   - A tree with n vertices has exactly (n-1) edges.
   - A graph is a tree if and only if it is minimally connected.
   - Any connected graph with n vertices and (n-1) edges is a tree
