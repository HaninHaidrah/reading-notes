# ethics in technology : 

* I chosed two articles from both topics mentioned in read and write my review as below : 

1. Ethics in the workplace

-  Article 4 : Microsoft Employees Protest Work With ICE, as Tech Industry Mobilizes Over Immigration
    > MY REVIEW: according to the application of ethical thinking to the practical concerns of technology, I strongly agree with what the employess did as protest .I  believe that any company must take an ethical stand, and put children and families above profit as they menthioned in the letter. its kind of of treating people in one of the worst way "inhumane" . I admit that the workers are on the top , they are the first people who are responsible for making profits , so they should have all of their rights.

2. Ethics in Technology
 - Article : Will Democracy Survive Big Data and Artificial Intelligence?
    > MY REVIEW : Life becomes more realable on technology specially the Artificial Intelligence, it affects our life and thinking .I beleive in somehow on what mentioned on the article . for explanation , the part that relates to how fast we improve and how strong our technology becomes , but on the other hand I dont think it will affect our world negatively . Always believe technology has two side we cant overwhelm one side on the other.
