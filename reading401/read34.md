## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. How do bearer tokens work?
    - The Bearer Token is created for you by the Authentication server. When a user authenticates your application (client) the authentication server then goes and generates for you a Token. Bearer Tokens are the predominant type of access token used with OAuth 2.0.
2. Describe express middleware
    - Express middleware are functions that execute during the lifecycle of a request to the Express server. Each middleware has access to the HTTP request and response for each route (or path) it's attached to. ... This “chaining” of middleware allows you to compartmentalize your code and create reusable middleware.
3. What is a JWT?
    - JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.
