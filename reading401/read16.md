## Review, Research, and Discussion

1.  Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle:
    - Its the journey from the client once he snds a request through http and then the server handles this request and check the database if it has the request and responds to the client
2.  Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC
    - its the computer who handles the request by listening to requests and then responds exactly to what is asked.
3.  What does it mean to “deploy” an application? \* means the process of installing, configuring, and enabling a specific application or set of applications, usually through an application manager (app manager) or software management system, to a specific URL on a server.

## DOCUMENTATION:

Server
:  a computer or computer program which manages access to a centralized resource or service in a network.

Pub/Sub
:  Pub/Sub, which stands for Publisher/Subscriber, allows services to communicate asynchronously, with latencies on the order of 100 milliseconds. Pub/Sub is used for streaming analytics and data integration pipelines to ingest and distribute data

WRRC
:  Its the journey from the client once he snds a request through http and then the server handles this request and check the database if it has the request and responds to the client


## Preview
Amazon Elastic => Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.

Amazon EC2 offers the broadest and deepest compute platform with choice of processor, storage, networking, operating system, and purchase model. We offer the fastest processors in the cloud and we are the only cloud with 400 Gbps ethernet networking. We have the most powerful GPU instances for machine learning training and graphics workloads, as well as the lowest cost-per-inference instances in the cloud. More SAP, HPC, Machine Learning, and Windows workloads run on AWS than any other cloud. Click here to learn What's New with Amazon EC2.
