# Reading: Component Based UI
## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)
    -  AngularJS
    - Ember.js
    - Vue.js
    - Webix
    - Sencha

2. What’s the difference between a framework and a library?
    - A library is a collection of precompiled routines that a program can use. ... Meanwhile, a framework is an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software.

 ## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

Rendering
:  is to show the html elemnts in the browser.

Templates
:  are sets of ready-to-use parts of code built using React technology for the development of dynamic user interfaces. ... Depending on the type and amount of included elements, React templates offer various packs of code from full-fledged pages for an app to a set of customizable UI components.

State
:   is a plain JavaScript object used by React to represent an information about the component's current situation. It's managed in the component (just like any variable declared in a function).

## PreviewIt 
**JSX**=> is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript.React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. We will come back to components in a further section, but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk might convince you otherwise.

**Rendering Elements**=> Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.
