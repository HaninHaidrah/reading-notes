* How do you graph data structures?
    - Vertex − Each node of the graph is represented as a vertex. ...
    - Edge − Edge represents a path between two vertices or a line between two vertices. ...
    - Adjacency − Two node or vertices are adjacent if they are connected to each other through an edge.

 * What is graph example?
